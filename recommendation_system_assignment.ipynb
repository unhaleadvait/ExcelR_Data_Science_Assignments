        "\n",
        "**1. Can you explain the difference between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering?**  \n",
        "\n",
        "These two types represent the user-based and item-based collaborative filtering, which are the main strategies of collaborative filtering, a popular method for recommendation systems. User-based collaborative filtering is a procedure whereby one looks for users similar to a target user in terms of preferences given the past ratings or interactions. Products not owned by a target user, but already tried and liked by these similar users, are then recommended to the target user. To illustrate, the system would recommend \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\" to User A, if User B is assumed to like it on the basis that both users A and B have rated \"Steins;Gate\" highly. The method mainly uses user similarity which in most cases is achieved through similarity measures such as Pearson correlation or cosine similarity.Conversely, item-based collaborative filtering does not depend on user similarity but rather item similarity. It uses everyone's ratings or interactions to discover items similar to those already liked by a target user. For instance, if a user liked \"Kimi no Na wa.\" and the system finds that \"Koe no Katachi\" has comparable ratings from other users, it proposes \"Koe no Katachi.\" This method is generally more scalable for large datasets because the item-to-item similarities can be precomputed and can be considered as relatively constant over time, while user preferences may change frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between the two is that item-based filtering focuses on the similarity between items whereas user-based filtering makes use of the similarity between users. While user-based methods may be handy in catching through quickly changing user preferences in rapidly changing environments, item-based methods are usually more efficient computationally and stable, hence, they perform better most of the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?**  \n",
        "\n",
        "Collaborative filtering is a recommendation system technique which by using collective behavior and preferences of a group of users, predicts a user's preferences without the need for explicit content analysis of the items. It essentially assumes that users that have agreed in the past (for example, by likes or ratings) will agree again. This method is very commonly used to recommend movies, products, or in this case, anime on websites like Netflix and Amazon.\n",
        "\n",
        " The method is based on a user-item interaction matrix, where users are represented by rows, items (like anime) are represented by columns, and ratings or interactions are indicated by the values (e.g., 1 for watched, 5 for a rating). The system finds patterns by calculating similarities between users (user-based) or items (item-based) through methods like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The system then uses the weighted average of ratings of similar users or for similar items to predict the preferences of the target user or item. Such predictions are then used to complete the matrix's missing entries and generate recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, collaborative filtering might suggest \"Ergo Proxy\" to a new user who gave \"Steins;Gate\" a high rating if several users who liked \"Steins;Gate\" also liked \"Ergo Proxy.\" Although the method is excellent at capturing subtle user preferences, it may have issues with sparsity (few ratings in large matrices) and cold-start (new users or items with no history). Although content-based cosine similarity was employed in this project, collaborative filtering could improve recommendations by integrating user rating data, if it is available."
