        "\n",
        "1. Sex_male is the most significant feature, with the largest negative coefficient (-2.6074). Being male drastically reduces survival probability, confirming that gender played a critical role in survival — likely due to the “women and children first” evacuation policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Pclass is also highly significant, with a coefficient of (-0.9334). Lower classes (higher Pclass values) are associated with lower survival chances, reflecting how social hierarchy influenced access to lifeboats.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Embarked_S and Embarked_Q have moderate effects, with Southampton and Queenstown passengers having lower survival odds compared to Cherbourg (33% and 10.3% lower, respectively). This may reflect socio-economic differences among passengers boarding at different ports.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. SibSp and Parch negatively affect survival, with coefficients of (-0.2881) and (-0.1172), respectively. Having more siblings/spouses or parents/children likely made it harder to escape — possibly because larger groups were more difficult to manage during evacuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Age has a small negative effect (-0.0306), suggesting that older passengers had slightly lower survival chances, possibly due to physical limitations during evacuation, though the effect is not as strong as gender or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Fare has a small positive effect (0.0026), indicating that higher fares (a proxy for wealth) slightly increased survival odds — likely because wealthier passengers had better access to lifeboats.\n",

        "7. PassengerId has negligible impact (0.0004), as expected, since it’s not a meaningful predictor of survival.\n",
