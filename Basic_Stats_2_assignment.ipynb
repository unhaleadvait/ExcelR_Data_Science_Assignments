        "Frequently, testing in manufacturing is done destructively and is costly. Hence, companies use minimal sample sizes, which show the quality of the products. In the present case, a manufacturer of print-head technology faces the requirement of estimating the number of characters that print-heads can print before they fail. Since each test destroys the print-head, only a small sample of 15 units was used\n",
